# Traffic Light - Teacher Feedback Tool

A VS Code extension that provides a quick way for students to give feedback to their teacher using the "Traffic Light" system (Red/Yellow/Green) within a dedicated webview.

This extension integrates directly with the Traffic Light web application, allowing you to:

*   Provide real-time, anonymous feedback during a class or session.
*   Create feedback rooms.
*   Share rooms easily using QR codes.

## Features

*   Opens the Traffic Light web application ([https://pavelfalta.github.io/](https://pavelfalta.github.io/)) in a convenient VS Code webview tab.
*   Launches the webview in a split editor view for easy access alongside your code.

## How to Use

1.  Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Type and run the command: **`Show Traffic Light`**
4.  The Traffic Light web application will open in a new webview tab, ready for you to join or create a feedback room.
